# Eat This!

## Introduction
Eat This! is a small DOM based browser game made for [Mini Jam 145](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-145-frozen) with the theme "Frozen". The limitation was that the game should include inconvenient superpowers. The game was made with Vue 3 and CSS, with the Vue app being a Single Page Application.

## Story
Ever since you were little, you had this dream: Becoming the best ice cream salesman this side of the frozen marshes. Not the typical choice for a fire spirit such as yourself. But you have set a goal for yourself and you will achieve it... Even if you have to serve a bit faster.
